            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>AISTER Doctour Kelliſon, as he hath vvritten diuers boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes tending to the Reconciliation of heretickes to the Catholique Church: ſo of late he ſette forthe a <hi>Treatiſe</hi> entitled: <hi>The Hierarchie of the Church,</hi> that thereby he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile ſome Catholiques, the one to the other, to vvit the ſecular Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie and Regulars, vvho, though both vvorthie members of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:10252:3"/>Church, ſeemed to be at ſome litle variance.</p>
            <p>The reaſon vvhy he published this Treatiſe, vvas, as I haue heard him ſaye, becauſe he vvas infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by letters, and perceiued by certaine vvritinges and Pamphlets vvritten toe and froe, that there vvas ſome diuiſion betvvixt the moſt Reuerend Bishop and Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie on the one ſide, and the Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars on the other ſide, to the greate griefe, I am ſure, of both ſides, to the edification of fevv, and dishonour of all.</p>
            <p>Wherfore partlie out of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion vvhich hee tooke to ſee tvvo ſo vvorthie bodyes (vvhich beare no litle ſvvaye in our litle Church of England, and vvhich heretofore ioyned both labours
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:10252:3"/>and bloud in ſetting forth the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique cauſe) to be ſo deuided in opinions and affections; and partlie at the requeſt of ſome frien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, vvho vvished vvell to bothe (for ſetting theſe tvvo motiues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, he vvould not haue entermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in ſo ticklish a buſines, vvher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he might offend one partie and peraduenture both, though he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noreth and loueth both, he vnder tooke the vvriting of the aforeſayd Treatiſe of the Hierarchie, and of diuers orders of the Church, that ſo he might take occaſion to vvrite of the dignirie and neceſſitie of Bishop, and ſecular Clergie, vvhich ſeemed by many clamours vvhich he heard of, and vvritings alſo vvhich he ſavve, to be oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; in ſo much that Epiſcopall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:10252:4"/>in England, and in theſe tymes vvas counted a <hi>noueltie, odious, contrarie to ancient lavves of England, and preiudiciall to ſoules,</hi> and yet to ſpeake alſo of the ſtate and perfection, belonging to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars, vvho ſeemed to bee oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, and ſo to diſpoſe both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes to peace and concord.</p>
            <p>And therfore he vvrote a long Dedicatorie Epiſtle to all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques of England, exhorting all to agree in affections as they doe in matters of fayth and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the Regulars to honour the ſeculars, and the ſeculars to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Regulars as their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovv miſſioners, ayders and coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratours. VVhich exhortation he oftentymes vpon occaſion repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in his Treatiſe, and hath not
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:10252:4"/>in all the booke ſo much as one bitter or tarte vvord againſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or ſtate, vnles novv and then a glaunce againſt Luther and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin: but ſo he extolleth the Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop and Clergie, as he depreſſeth not the Regulars, but giueth them as much as S. Thomas of Aquin an holy and learned regular doth yeeld vnto them. Jn ſo much that diuers vvere of opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and he him ſelf alſo verilie hoped, that this Treatiſe vvould not haue offended any, but rather vvould haue plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all, and by pleaſing all, induced all to an attoneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Out of vvhich hope and opinion he feared not to put his name vnto his booke, nor to preſent it as a gratefull guift to the cheefe of our English Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars in Dovvay, vvhere the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:10252:5"/>booke vvas printed.</p>

            <p>Some freinds haue vrged him to make a Replye to this <hi>Diſcuſsion</hi> fathered on <hi>M. Nicholas Smith:</hi> but <hi>M. Doctour</hi> had not (as he ſayd) the harte to vvrite againſt a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique and him a Regular, counting it no grace to diſgrace a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, noe victorie to ouercome him: and fearing leaſt in vvriting againſt him, he might contriſtate other Catholiques, and noe leſſe make glad our common enemyes, vvho imagine our vvarre to be their peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:10252:6"/>Yea <hi>M. Doctour</hi> vſed to ſaye: To vvhat purpoſe should J anſvvere one vvho vvriteth not againſt mee. For I neuer think that he vvriteth againſt mee, vvho vvilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie or ignorantlie miſtaketh my vvords and meaning, and putteth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mee vvhat I neuer ſayd or me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that ſo he may haue the greater aduantage and make a shovv of a victorie. But he vvriteth againſt mee (ſayd the <hi>Doctour</hi>) vvho vvri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth againſt my vvords and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: and if he fathereth on mee (as <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> vſeth to doe) that vvhich J neuer ſayd or ment, and in that ſorte maketh his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault; hee aſſaulteth not mee, but a ſuppoſed and fayned aduerſarie. And yet if <hi>M. Nicholas,</hi> had not fayned ſuch an aduerſarie, he could
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:10252:6"/>not haue made ſo much as a shovv of an anſvvere to the Hierarchie as shall euerie vvhere be shevved in the decourſe of this reply. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides (ſayd <hi>M.

Nicholas</hi> him ſelfe vvas foyled. And moreouer he ſayd the booke vvill anſvver for it ſelfe, and the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Reader (as he heareth a learned deuine in his <hi>Jnquiſition,</hi> and ſome others haue done) vvill out of it anſvvere for him. And laſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:10252:7"/>of all, he ſayd: vvhy should I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter vvith an aduerſarie that dareth not shevv him ſelfe in the field, and therfore goeth masked vnder another ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s name: though it is thought he vvalketh rather in a nette; the queſtion, vvho he should be, being not ſo hard to ſolue, as <hi>Gordius</hi> his <hi>Knotte</hi> vvas to bee diſſolued.</p>
            <p>Yet out of the reſpect and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction J beare to <hi>M. Doctour,</hi> and in regard of the obligation vvherby J ame obliged to him (as hauing liued vnder his gouernment) and out of the care I haue of his good name and reputation (vvhich I thought could not be impeached vvithout ſome preiudice to the common cauſe) J haue vndertaken to anſvver for him, and in this my
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:10252:7"/>Reply to imitate the temper and moderation vvhich hee in his <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchie</hi> hath vſed: and not to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovv the ſplene, bitternes, immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie and ſmale reſpect of <hi>M.

            </p>
            <p>Many, vvho haue redde <hi>M.

            <p>VVhat is there in <hi>M. Doctours</hi> booke vvhich ſo moueth his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience? J ame ſure there is not one tarte vvord in all <hi>M. Doctours</hi> booke: and he vvriteth againſt noe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:10252:8"/>perſon, noe ſtate, noe order; nor meddleth he vvith the late contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie, and for no other reaſon but becauſe he vvould not offend. It is true he vvriteth of the Hierarchie of the Church, and of all orders: but that is a point of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique fayth, vvhich (as <hi>M.

            <p>And therfore novv I addreſſe my ſpeache vnto you the Reuerend and venerable Priests of
<pb facs="tcp:10252:14"/>our afflicted Church, deſiring you, that ſeing I haue ſette before your eyes (vvhich othervviſe you knevve) the perfection of the states, both of Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops, Pastours, and Regulars: you vvould honour one another,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.</note> yea in <hi>honour prenent one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and lay a ſide all contentions, that (as the Apostle vvisheth) <hi>you may be of one mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, hauing the ſame charitie,<note place="margin">Philip. 2.</note> of one mynde agreeuig in one: nothing by conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neither by vaine glorie, but in humilitie, eahe counting other better then them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, euerie one not conſidering the thinges that are their ovvne, but thoſe that are other mens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And trulie if one order had not too greate an ouervveening of its ovvne perfections, but rather vvould caſt an eye vpon the perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of another, vvhich vvilbe fovvnd to excelle in one thing or other: this conſideration vvould cauſe humilitie, and humilitie charitie, and charitie peace and amitie. So our bleſsed ſauiour Christe Ieſus God and man, though euen as man he vvas greater in dignitie and ſanctitie then all the men that euer vvere, though neuer ſo holy (of vvhich alſo he vvas not ignorant) yet he as man conſidering not ſo much the perfection he had by vnion vvith the diuinitie, as vvhat he vvas according to his huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne nature take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> barelie and nakedlie in it ſelfe; and comparing him ſelfe vvith the grace and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie he ſavve in others, humiliated him ſelfe in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite vnder others, vvho in state and dignitie

So the Bleſsed virgine Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Mother of God: ſo all the Sainctes of God, conſidering not vvhat they vvere by grace (though they knevv it full vvell) but vvhat of them ſelues they vvere, and casting an eye of that vvhich others vvere by the diuine grace; cast them ſelues in conceite at the feete of all men, euen thoſe that vvere farre inferiour vnto them. If all orders vvould practiſe this, none vvould contend vvith another fer perfection or ſtate of perfection.</p>
            <p>Let the Clergieman (ſayth Thomas Walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis) looke into the ſtate of the religions,<note place="margin">Th.

               <hi>eahe vvill count other better then them ſelues, becauſe euerie one</hi> (as S. Paules coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelleth them) <hi>conſidereth not the thinges</hi> and perfections, <hi>that are his ovvne, but thoſe that are other mens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this they doe, noe order vvill preferre it ſelfe before another, but rather thinck more lovvlie of it ſelfe then of another and ſo contention vvilbe auoided: If this they doe, none vvill bragge of their ovvne state and perfection, but all vvill stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and endeuour to get perfection: knovving that it is not the state or office, but the holy life and merit vvhich God eſpeciallie reſpecteth; and that if one liue not according to his ſtate, the higher his ſtate is, the greater is his damnation; for that
<pb facs="tcp:10252:15"/>from the highest place is the lovveſt fall. The ſtate of S. Paule and S. Peter is high, but as S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome ſayth:<note place="margin">Hieron Ep. ad Heliod.</note>

            <p>S.

<pb facs="tcp:10252:15"/>Religions, he maketh this protestation: <hi>Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citer autem fateor charitati veſtrae coram Domino Deo noſtro, &amp;c. I confeſſe ſimplie to your charitie befere our Lord God, vvho is vvitnes vpon my ſoule, from ſuch tyme as I began to ſerue God; as I haue hardelie experienced or found better then ſuch as haue profited in religion; ſo I haue not found vvorſe then ſuch as in monaſteries haue fallen.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epiſt. 1 37.</note> But as gold is not to be refuſed for its droſſe, nor vvine for the lees, nor the good corne for the Chaffe; ſo neither are ſtares and orders of the Church to be leſſe conceited, becauſe ſome mens li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues are not ſutable to their order and profeſſion.</p>
            <p>All orders are holy, yet none ſo holye but that the ſuperiour order vvanteth ſome thing of the inferiour. The state of the Regular is inferiour to the ſtate of the Bishop and Paſtour in dignitie, and Hierarchiall functions, but it is leſse ſubiect to danger, and ſo exceedeth in ſecuritie. The ſtate of the Bishop and Pastour hath annexed vnto it greate honour, but this <hi>honos</hi> is <hi>onus,</hi> this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is a greater charge and burde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars state, becauſe it is harder to ſaue ones ſelfe and others, vvhich is the Paſtours office, then to ſaue ones ſelfe only, vvhich is the care of the Religions. Let then the Paſtours behold in the Regular merit and mortificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: let the Regular admire in the Bishop and Pastour great dignitie, and no leſse charitie in engaging his ovvne life yea ſoule for others: and the one vvill not deſpiſe the

The trueth: becauſe he knoweth that before M. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour ſet penne to paper about this ſubiect, there was a booke of the like ſubiect published firſt in French, then in Latin, printed, as is pretended, at Herbipolis in the yeare 1626. then in English at Roan where the <hi>Diſcuſsion</hi> was printed: and in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, this booke is ſtiled <hi>Vindiciae priuilegiorum &amp; gratiarum, quibus in Eccleſiaſtica Hierarchia &amp;c.</hi> in which booke the Authour in his <hi>ſecond reaſon,</hi> endeauoureth to prooue <hi>Regulars</hi> to be of the <hi>Hierarchie</hi> by the arguments, which <hi>M.

Doctour</hi> was <hi>the firſt who hath put in printe a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe</hi> of the Hierarchie <hi>in the English tongue,</hi> ſeing that the Treatiſe mentioned was printed and diuulged in England before. And in Queen Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabethes
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:10252:23"/>tyme (as <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> or ſome of his brethren muſt needs know) a treatiſe was ſet forth in a lay mans name to shew that Religions were fitter to heare Confeſſions, then Secular Prieſts.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. He ſeemeth alſo to contradict himſelfe, for that <hi>n.</hi> 2. he ſaieth that <hi>diuers haue handled this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> (before M.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:10252:24"/>But now ſince we haue had a Bishop, it is a queſtion, whether they should not aske appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation in England, as they doe in other Countries: which queſtion MY LORD OF CHALCEDON, and others haue learnedlie diſputed: I will not meddle with it in this Reply, becauſe <hi>M.

                  <p n="10">10. I allow alſo of that which <hi>M.

Of this I could ſay more, but I was loath to haue ſayed thus much, had not <hi>M.

And hence it followeth alſo that without a Bishop, who is the Ordinarie mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of <hi>Confirmation,</hi> we cannot, by ordinarie courſe, be perfect Chriſtians, becauſe we cannot haue <hi>Confirmation,</hi> which maketh vs perfect Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, as <hi>S.

                  <p n="24">24. Yea they want not apparent reaſon.

If by reaſon of the <hi>power of Order,</hi> then as the Pope cannot giue power to a deacon to conſecrate, becauſe that is proper to the Character and Order of a Prieſt, ſo he cannot giue power to a Prieſt to confirme, that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the Character and Order of a Bishop. If the authours of the other opinion ſay, that the Prieſts Character of it ſelfe is ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, they should contradict the Fathers alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, who ſay that to confirme, is proper to the Bishop, and cánot agree to the Prieſt not Bishop. Beſides thence it would follow that though the Prieſt in confirming might ſinne, Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation being reſerued to Bishops, yet as a Prieſt ſuſpended if he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrate, though he ſinneth, yet conſecration is valid: ſo if a Prieſt should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme he should ſinne, yet Confirmation would be valid, it being not aboue his character. And this opinion would anſwere to the fact of Saint Gregorie, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which the contrarie opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> much relieth; that S.

                  <p n="25">25. And to the Councells of <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Trent;</hi> which ſay that the ordinarie Miniſter of <hi>Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> is the Bishop, as though the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie miniſter might be the Prieſt; They anſwere that theſe two Councells define, that at leaſt the

And whereas the Councell of Florence ſayeth that <hi>It is read</hi> that ſometimes by the diſpenſation of the Sea Apoſtolike a ſimple Prieſt hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed; they anſwere the Councell defineth not that this indeed hath euer beene done, but that it is read ſoe. Thus they.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. But for all this, <hi>S. Thomas</hi> his opinion is moſt probable, being now eſpeciallie moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, though not moſt ſecure. And this opinion would alledge for it, the fact of <hi>S. Gregorie</hi> and the twoe councells alledged.

The firſt is that, which I haue often alledged, becauſe the gouernement of Bishops is inſtituted by Chriſt, and hath beene in practiſe in the greateſt perſecution, as wee haue ſeene in the former Chapter. My ſecondreaſon is, becauſe the commoditie which a prouince reapeth by a Bishop is ſo greate, and the want of him, is ſuch a loſſe, that wee should rather hazard perſecution (as the Aſrica<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Catholiks did) the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be depriued of a Bishop.</hi> And in this his ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d maine reaſon he includeth 1. the neceſſitie of a Bishop to make a perfect Chriſtian: 2. the vtilitie or neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of Confirmation. 3. that without a Bishop there can be no particular Church. 4. that by Ordinarie courſe without a Bishop there can be no Hierarchicall functions.

For that as the ſoule vnited to the body maketh a man, and ſeparated from it, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no man: ſo the people vnited to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Bishop maketh a particular Church; and if it be not vnited to him, maketh no particular Church, becauſe it is not a people vnited to the particular Bishop; yet it may be a member of the whole and vniuerſall Church, if it be vnited to the reſt of the Catholik Church and her chiefe paſtour. Whereas they who are ſeparated from their Bishop by ſchiſme, are not onelie no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church, as being not vnited to their Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop, but alſo are no members of the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſeparated by Schiſme: So they who are ſeparated onelie negatiuelie, are no particular Church, becauſe they haue no Bishop, yet are members of the whole Church, becauſe they are
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:10252:37"/>not ſeparated by Schiſme.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. And <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> may learne by that which I ſaied be fore (if he knew it not before) that it is not all one to be a particular Church or body, and and to be a member of the Church: and that euerie particular Church, is a member of the whole Church, but not euerie member of the Church, is a particular Church; becauſe <hi>M. Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi> alone is a member of the Church, but no particular Church, and euery Catholike familie is a member of the Church, but not a particular Church; as euerie ſubiect &amp; euerie towne or vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage is a me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of the Empire, which contayneth many particular Kingdomes, yet is it not a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Kingdome; for that a particular Kingdome requireth not onely to be ſubiect to the Emperour, but alſo to haue a particular King vnder the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour. And therefore if the Emperour would for euer depriue a countrie of the dignitie of a Kingdome, by decreeing that it should neuer haue a King againe, it should ceaſe to be a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but should ſtill remaine a member ſubiect to the Emperour, in qualitie of a parte and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Empire, but not in qualitie of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Kingdome. And I wonder <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> doth not ſee this, as it ſeemeth he doth not, in that he ſo often inculcateth it, and ſeemeth to thinke it moſt certaine, that the Catholikes in England remaining ſtill good Catholikes, not ſeparated by Schiſme, muſt needs haue beene a particular Church all the while they had no Bishop.</p>

                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:10252:38"/>16. In like manner that argument which he frameth againſt <hi>M. Doctour num.</hi> 6. out of <hi>S.

Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi> his errour ſo often refuted, by which he thinketh it is all one not to be cutte of from the Bishop by Schiſme, and to be a particular Church; whereas how ſoeuer a people wanteth a particular Bishop, whether by Schiſme, or not ſchiſme, it can be no particular Church, becauſe it cannot be a people vnited to its Bishop, when it hath no Bishop. Yet let vs heare his argument. Thus then he argueth: <hi>Whoſoeuer are not in Schiſme with any lawfull Bishop, doe fulfill the definition of a Church giuen by S. Cyprian: but thoſe who haue no Bishop, are not in Schiſme with any lawfull Bishop;</hi> Ergo <hi>thoſe who haue no Bishop, do fulfill the definition of a Church giuen by S. Cyprian.</hi> But <hi>M. Doctour</hi> I am ſure would deny the firſt and <hi>Maior</hi> propoſition of this <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> his Syllogiſme; for that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of a Church giuen by <hi>S.

And if I should retorte the like argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on <hi>M Nicholas,</hi> he would peraduenture ſee his errour, and the weakeneſſe of his owne argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For I could argue in the like manner: <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:10252:38"/>are not in Schiſme with any lawfull Bishop, do fulfill the definition of a Church giuen by S.

                  <p n="19">19. It is eaſilie ſayed <hi>M. Nicholas:</hi> but not ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilie proued, as partelie may appeare by that which is alreadie ſayed: and <hi>S.

                  <p n="20">20. But how prooueth he that the Catholikes of England may be a Church without a Bishop? Becauſe (ſaieth hee) <hi>the Pope in defect of particular Bishops, is the particular Bishop, Ordinarie, and Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan of ſuch Churches; as Philoſophers do teach, that almightie God the ſupreme and vniuerſall cauſe of all effectes, concurreth not onelie as an immediate, but alſo as a particular cauſe to the producing of effectes, when ſecond particular cauſes doe faile.</hi> Thus he.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. And if he meane that the Pope hath beene a particular Bishop to England, he muſt shewe it, elſe <hi>M. Doctour</hi> may ſtill ſay, that all the while England was without a particular Bishop, it was no particular Church; or if he thinke he may ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue <hi>à poſſibili ad eſſe,</hi> from poſſibilitie to actuall being, as if becauſe the Pope can be Englands proper Bishop, therefore be hath beene ſo; then euerie one should be what he may be; and ſo <hi>M.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:10252:40"/>yeares of age, becauſe he may be; and be should now be at Rome againe, becauſe he may be. If he meane that the Pope ſo ſoone as a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie or Dioceſe wanteth a Bishop, is actuallie that countries or Prouinces particular Bishop, no Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoprike should be vacant; becauſe ſo ſoone as the particular Bishop is dead, that Pope is the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Bishop. And ſo when a Rectour of a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is dead, the Prouinciall should be Rectour, and when the Prouinciall is deceaſed, the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall should be Prouinciall, and no office should euer be vacant; becauſe the Superiour officer should ſupply it; which is abſurd: and yet be it neuer ſo abſurde, it ſeemeth <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For he ſaieth; <hi>that the Pope in defect of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Bishop, is the particular Bishop, ordinaie and Dioceſan of ſuch Churches,</hi> to wit, which want a particular Bishop. Which is a ſtrange opinion of <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> his owne inuention. And by this his doctrine it would follow, that if <hi>per impoſſibile</hi> there were neuer a particular Bishop, in all the Church but the Pope, the Church should ſtill be Hierarchicall, compoſed of diuers particular Churches, becauſe the Pope should be in that caſe not onelie an vniuerſall Bishop of all the Church, but alſo a particular Bishop of euerie particular Church, and ſo one ſole Bishop (the Pope) should make a Hierarchie, which conſiſteth of diuers particular Churches.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. Yet I will not denie, but that the Pope to honour a Bishoprick which before his Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:10252:41"/>he enioyed, may retaine ſtill the Title of that Bishopricke,<note place="margin">Ex Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron. anno. 1849. Leon Papa 9 anno 1.</note> as Leo IX. did the Title of the Bisho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricke of Tulle. Yea he may though vniuerſall Bishop of the vniuerſall Church, be alſo the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Bishop of a particular Church, as he is <hi>de facto</hi> particular Bishop of S. Ihon Lateran: but then he muſt ether do the office there of a Bishop by himſelfe, or by his delegate; or at leaſt he muſt take vnto himſelfe the Title of that Church, not onelie in name, but in verie deed; elſe he shall not be a particular Bishop. I ſay, <hi>or at leaſt he muſt take vnto himſelfe he Title;</hi> for that ſeemeth to be ſufficient to make a particular Bishop, as we may gather by diuers examples: for that there is a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of Hieruſalem in Rome, who neither doth the office there by himſelfe, or anie dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, becauſe he cannot be permitted; and <hi>my Lord of Chalcedon,</hi> though he do the office of a Bishop onely in England, and not at Chalcedon, ether by himſelfe, or his delegate becauſe it will not be permitted him to do ſo; Yet he is truelie the particular Bishop of Chalcedon, becauſe he hath the Title and right to gouerne that Church graunted vnto him.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. Now therefore if <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> can shew me that the Pope hath done the office of a Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop in England by himſelfe or his delegate, or that he hath taken to himſelfe the Title of the Bishop of England, I shall graunte that all this while wee had no particular Bishop in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, he hath beene our particular Bishop: If he cannot,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:10252:41"/>as all the world knoweth he cannot: for nether hath the Pope beene in England in perſon, nor hath he ſent before theſe twoe moſt Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Bishops anie Bishop into England to do there the offices of a Bishop, which is to confirme and ordaine; nor hath he euer take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto him the Title of the Bishop of England: then <hi>M. Doctours</hi> aſſertion is true, to wit, that all the while England had no particular Bishop, it was no particular Church, becauſe, as <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> ſayeth, the Church is <hi>a people vnited to the Bishop,</hi> which England could not be, when it had no Bishop. It is true the Pope is Bishop of the whole Church, and ſo of England, as it was a member of the whole: but he hauing neuer done there the office of a Bishop by himſelfe or his delegate, nor euer taking vnto him the Title of the Bishop of England, he was not Englands particular Bishop, and ſo England by him could be no particular Church.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. To <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> his ſimilitude which he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maketh betwixt God the firſt and vniuerſall cauſe of all effectes, and the Pope the vniuerſall Bishop; I anſwere, that as God can ſupplie the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall actions of ſecond cauſes, called <hi>Actiones tranſeuntes,</hi> &amp; therefore can produce heate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fire, a man without a man, a tree without a tree, as he did in the firſt creation of things: Yet he cannot, as ſome hould, produce immanent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s without their particular cauſes, and powers: &amp; ſo cannot produce the act of ſeing without the eye of hearing, without the eare, of loue without
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:10252:42"/>the will, of vnderſtading without the power of vnderſtanding. But how ſoeuer; as God can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the former externall actions without their particular cauſes, and ſo ſupplie the ſecond cauſe: So the Pope if he be not onelie elected Pope, but alſo conſecrated, can do all the actions by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, which Patriarches, Archbishops, Bishops, Prieſts and other inferiour Miniſters can do. For he can ordaine Miniſters, and confirme the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized with the Bishop; he can conſecrace, abſolue, and miniſter other Sacraments, and preach with the Prieſt; Yea he can do other inferiour offices with the Deacon, Subdeacon and thereſt, though it be not ſo conuenient he should. And ſoe as God ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be not onely an vniuerſall but alſo a particular cauſe, ſupplying the particular cauſe: ſo the Pope can be a particular Bishop, but then he muſt do the office of a particular Bishop by himſelfe, or his delegate, or take the Title of that particular Church vnto him.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. That the Pope hath founded Seminaries of Prieſts for our countrie; that he hath ſent the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther firſt Prieſts, and then Religious men (as <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> telleth vs <hi>n</hi> 8. and we all gratefullie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge) to preach and miniſter Sacramentes in our Countrie; as this argueth his greate care of England, and his no leſse charitie; ſo it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guerh not (as <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> would make his reader beleiue) that he was our particular Bishop; he neither by himſelfe, nor by his delegate doing the office of a Bishop in England, nor euer hauing
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:10252:42"/>taken vnto him the Title of the Bishop of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland. And ſo ſince the deceaſe of our ould Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops, to theſe late yeares, in which his Holines ſent vs twoe moſt worthie Bishops, England was no particular Church, becauſe it had no particular Bishop to make it a particular Church,</p>
                  <p n="26">26. And by this <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> may gather an anſwere to all that he ſayeth <hi>n.</hi> 8.9.10.12.13. In his 11. nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber he obiecteth againſt this; that many places and <hi>perſons are exempt from the Iuriſdiction of a Bishop, be fides the Pope: neither did any man euer dreame, that for that cauſe they ceaſed to be particular Churches.</hi> I here pitie <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> his arguing, and the neceſſitie he is driuen to, which <hi>Cogit ad turpia.</hi> For although monaſteries be exempt from the Bishop and immediatlie ſubiect to the Pope; yet no particular co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation or multitude, that is a particular Church, can be exempt from a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Bishop, as we haue proued out of <hi>S. Cyprians</hi> definition of a Church, vnleſſe the Pope make himſelfe particular Bishop of it. And therefore monaſteries ſubiect onely to the Pope, and exe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt from particular Bishops, are indeed members of the Church, but not a particular Church; vnleſſe <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> will make euerie nunnerie of woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men a particular Church.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. But here I cannot but meruayle that <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> thinketh it ſo ſtrange that <hi>M. Doctour</hi> ſayeth, that there cannot be a particular Church without a Bishop; and it should ſeeme thereby
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:10252:43"/>that he hath not much conſidered <hi>S. Thomas</hi> his doctrine in this pointe. For that this learned Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour ſayeth,<note place="margin">D. Th. libr. 4. gent. c. 76. n. 4.1. p. q. 108. art. 1.2.3.</note> that the <hi>Church militant, is deriued by ſimilitude from the Triumphant:</hi> and he ſayeth alſo that euerie Order of the Angels conſiſteth of diuers Angels ſubordinate to one Prince, who in this Doctours opinion is higher and perfecter in nature the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the reſt, and is the particular Prince of that Order; and all the orders with their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Princes are ſubiect to one ſupreme Angel, who is Prince of the three Hierarchies, and nine Orders of Angels: And therefore in the Church militant, in euerie notable parte of it, there muſt be, and moſt commonlie is, a Bishop, a ſpirituall Prince of that Church, and all the particular Churches with their particular Hierarches and Bishops, are ſubordinate to one ſupreme Bishop, the Pope, as <hi>M. Doctour</hi> hath proued in the 3. and 4. <hi>Chapter</hi> of his <hi>Hierarchie.</hi> And therefore in his 2. <hi>Chapter</hi> he ſayeth that the Church is compared to a Kingdome, in which beſides the King are Dukes, Earles, Marquiſes, Barons, &amp;c. who are princes, in their kinde, of their particular domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and all are, with their Dominions &amp; Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, ſubordinate to the King: and if any of theſe particular dominions be quite depriued of their Duke, or Earle, they are no more Dutchies or Earledomes; though ſtill they be members of the Kingdome; and ſo that particular Prouince depriued of its Duke or Earle, giueth not that luſtre to the Kingdome, which it hath by other
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:10252:43"/>particular Lordships, and bodyes of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. In like manner the Church being a Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchie, is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poſed of diuers particular Churches of which euerie one hath its particular Bishop, who is not the Popes delegate, but an ordinarie, and a Prince in his kind: and the Church recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth by this varietie of particular Bishops &amp; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches, a greate luſtre. And when any notable parte of it wanteth its particular Bishop and ſpirituall prince, although the Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ſtill a Hierarchie, in reſpect of other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches, which haue their particular Hierarche and Bishop; yet in reſpect of that parte of the Church, which hath no Bishop, and which therefore is not a particular Church or body, it is not perfectlie Hierarchicall, nor hath it by that parte of the Church that varietie, and luſtre, which it hath by other parts, of which euerie one hath its particular Bishop.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. Wherefore when the Pope giueth to a countrie a delegated Bishop, though many times he giueth to the delegate more power then the ordinarie hath, although that countrie then be in its kinde a particular Church, yet it wanteth ſome perfection, it being not gouerned by an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie Bishop and Paſtour, as other Churches are, it being more perfect, and more honorable to haue an ordinarie, then a delegate. And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if the Pope should ſend a ſimple Prieſt into Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with power to confirme, England should
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:10252:44"/>be in its kinde a particular Church, but not in that degree of perfection, as if it had an ordinarie Bishop and Paſtour.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="31">31. <hi>M. Doctours</hi> argument is good and ſolid: for as the whole and vniuerſall Church requireth a a ſupreme and vniuerſall Bishop ouer all, to make it a whole Church; ſo a particular Church requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a particular Bishop to make it a particular Church, as aboue is often proued; and otherwiſe if particular Churches had not their particular Bishop, the whole and vniuerſall Church, which conſiſteth of many particular Churches, should not be a Hierarchie, as Chriſt hath inſtituted. But <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> not ſo modeſtlie as were to be expected of one of his coate, ſayeth that this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument deſerueth no anſwere, and why? <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſayeth hee, <hi>who dare ſay, that there is as great neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie or obligation to haue a Bishop in euerie particular Church, as to haue one ſupreme head of the Whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="32">
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:10252:45"/>32. And thus (as he vſeth to doe) taking <hi>M. Doctour</hi> wilfullie or ignorantlie in a wrong ſenſe he runneth on. For <hi>M. Doctour</hi> onely ſayed, that as the whole and vniuerſall Church cannot be a whole Church, without a ſupreme and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall Bishop; ſo a particular Church cannot be a particular Church without a particular Bishop: whence by no Logick it followeth that there is abſolutelie as greate neceſſitie of a particular Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop, as of the vniuerſall and ſupreme Bishop. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Church cannot be at all without a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Bishop, or nor without order to him, when the Sea is vaca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: but it may ſubſiſt though a particular Bishop, and his Church alſo should fall from the Church by Schiſme or hereſie, and it should ſtill remaine Hierarchicall in other particular Churches, which haue their particular Bishops, as is eaſie to ſee by that, which is all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie ſaied. For although the Greeke Church for the greateſt parte be cutte of from the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine Church by ſchiſme and hereſie, and ſo the Roman Church in it, is not Hierarchicall, yet the Roman Church ſtill ſubſiſteth, and is Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicall in other Churches.</p>
                  <p>And this I shall illuſtrate by an example. The Empire is an vniuerſall Kingdome which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth in it diuers particular Kingdomes. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the whole Kingdome of the Empire can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a whole Kingdome without a ſupreme King and Emperour; ſo a particular Kingdome of the whole Empire cannot be a particular
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:10252:45"/>Kingdome without a particular King, but yet there is not abſolutelie ſuch neceſſitie of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular King or Kingdome, as of the Emperour, who is ſupreme King. For that although that a particular King and Kingdome should be caſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and should be no more a Kingdome, nor haue its particular King, yet the Empire might ſtill ſubſiſt by its ſupreme King and Emperour, and by other Kingdomes, which are gouerned by him. And therefore <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> forceth me to ſay that he sheweth a greate deale of ſplene to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>M. Doctour,</hi> in taking <hi>M. Doctour</hi> in a wrong ſenſe, as though he had ſayed that there was as great neceſſitie of a particular, as of a ſupreme Bishop; and then inferring, <hi>that his doctrine is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to a deeper cenſure then he is willing to expreſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="33">33. And what Cenſure, I pray you, <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> deſerueth it to ſay, that as the whole Catholike Church cannot be without a ſupreme and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall Bishop; ſo a particular Church cannot be a particular Church, without a particular Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop? In what councell doth <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> find this cenſured? And doth not common ſenſe and reaſon cenſure <hi>M. Nicholas,</hi> for calling this in queſtion? Is it any more then to ſaye, that as an Empire and vniuerſall Kingdome requireth a ſupreme King and Emperour, ſo a particular Kingdome of the ſayed Empire requireth a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular King? And to inferre hence that <hi>M. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour</hi> ſayeth a particular Bishop is as neceſſarie, as the ſupreme Bishop is, to vphould the Church of

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:10252:48"/>that as there is feare leaſt he be apprehended, ſo there is hope he may eſcape ſometime, and ſo do ſome notable good: I do not thinke that the Catholikes of that Countrie can except against his entrance.</hi>

For, ſuppoſing that Chriſt hath inſtituted a Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchie compoſed of diuers particular Churches, gouerned by particular Bishops, and hath giuen to the Church authoritie to make this diuiſion of diuers Churches and Dioceſes; <hi>Sotus,</hi> as by the former words may be gathered, is of opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that ſuppoſing the diuiſion of Dioceſes, euerie Dioceſe (much more euerie notable part of the Church, as England, France &amp;c.) is by the diuine law and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:10252:53"/>appointement to haue its Bishop, not Peter, or Paul, but one indeterminatelie: and this by vertue of our Sauiours inſtitution in generall, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that order is ſette generallie, and euerie where to be obſerued, <hi>Singulis Eccleſijs vt ſui applicentur Epiſcopi; that to euerie particular Church their proper Bishop should be applyed.</hi> And thus in generall, the election of Bishops is <hi>Deiure diuino, of the diuine law.</hi> And therefore when a Pope doth applie a Bishop to a Dioceſe, he doth but that which our Sauiour, hath before inſtituted in his generall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and commandement, <hi>Vt ſingulis Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſijs ſui applicentur Epiſcopi; that to euerie Church their proper Bishops should be applyed.</hi>

                  <p n="18">18. That the diuiſion of Dioceſes is Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall, that is, introduced by the Church, it is not materiall; for that according to <hi>Sotus</hi> the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine law ſtillis generall, commanding in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall that all Dioceſes diuided by the Church, be they more or fewer, of greater or leſſe extent, each muſt haue its Bishop in it.</p>

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:10252:54"/>ſuch an action ought to be ſayed of the diuine law.</hi> Whence <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> ſayeth, it is plaine againſt <hi>M. Doctour,</hi> that <hi>Sotus</hi> ſpeaketh of the Inſtitution of Chriſt onely in generall.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. But <hi>M. Nicholas,</hi> goeth about to deceiue men in generalities, when he biddes vs <hi>Marke,</hi> that <hi>Sotus</hi> ſayeth that Chriſt onely inſtituted and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded in generall that there should be Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops. For that this may haue two meanings; the one, that Chriſt inſtituted and communded onely in generall, that there should be Bishops in the Church: and this is <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> his interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: The other, that Chriſt in generall inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted and commanded, that not onely in generall there should be Bishops in the Church, but alſo that euerie particular Church or Dioceſe (after the diuiſion of Dioceſes made) should haue its Bishop, and this is <hi>Sotus</hi> his meaning, as I haue shewed out of his words aboue alledged; and as may appeare euen by his laſt words cited by <hi>M.

For ſeing that it is the diuine law, that to euerie Dioceſe its owne Bishops should be manci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated or bound;</hi> (he ſayeth not onely that in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall there muſt by the diuine law be ſome Bishops in the Church, but alſo that by the diuine law to euerie Dioceſe its owne Bishop muſt be bound and mancipated) and then he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the reaſon,<note place="margin">Sot in 4 diſt 20 q 1. art. 5 Concl. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>for the peculiar care and vigilancie, which is neceſſarie to that Church:</hi> And in another place he giueth alſo the reaſon why the Pope onely is not ſufficient to gouerne the whole Church without Bishops, nor a Bishop the whole Dioceſe without Paſtours: <hi>Si autem alio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum rationem deſideres, haec eſt egregia, quod officium Paſtoris eſt ad ſalutem gregis oculatè attendere: ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus autem Eccleſiae Paſtor non ſufficit toti Eccleſiae prospicere, niſi ſingulis Dioeceſibus Epiſcopos praeficiat; neque Epiſcopus toti Dioeceſi, niſi parochijs, parochia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les Sacerdotes praeponat. But if thou deſire the reaſon of others, this is a notable reaſon, becauſe the office of a Paſtour is to attend with a vigilant eye to the ſafetie of the flocke: but the ſupreme Paſtour is not ſufficient to looke to the whole Church, vnleſſe he ordaine to each Dioceſe a Bishop, and vnleſſe the Bishop conſtitute Parish Priests to the Parochiall Churches.</hi> So that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:10252:55"/>ſeing the Pope is bound by the diuine law to haue care of the whole Church; and that according to <hi>Sotus,</hi> he cannot looke ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently to the Church vnleſſe he appoint to eche Dioceſe a Bishop, it followeth in <hi>Sotus</hi> his opinion, that by the diuine law, he is bound to giue euerie Dioceſe his Bishop, as the Bishop is bound to giue to euerie Parish its Paſtour.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. But <hi>M. Nicholas n.</hi> 10. ſayeth that <hi>Sotus</hi> alſo ſayeth that ſacramentall abſolution, and the like are to be eſteemed of the diuine law; and yet it were a madneſſe, out of theſe words to inferre, that the miniſter is bound by the diuine law, to adminiſter Sacraments. I anſwer, that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are of the diuine law, though men diſpenſe them: and ſo according to <hi>Sotus,</hi> that euerie Church should haue its Bishop, it is of the diuine law, though the Pope elect him. This is the Scope of <hi>Sotus,</hi> as appeareth by theſe words, <hi>Nunquid propterea quod per miniſterium Dei &amp;c.

                  <p n="24">24. Now whether all this which <hi>Sotus</hi> ſaieth, be true or no, <hi>M.

Nicholas</hi> his ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of arguing, I shall explicate, and confirme <hi>M. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour</hi> his aſſertion, by which he auerreth, that by
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:10252:57"/>the diuine law, in euerie notable parte of the Church there muſt be a Bishop: Which I shall eaſilie do, ſuppoſing <hi>M. Doctours</hi> ground, to wit, that the Church muſt not be gouerned by one onelie ſupreme Bishop, but alſo by other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Bishops, who are to gouerne particular Churches; becauſe the ſupreme Bishop alone cannot by himſelfe gouerne the Church; and becauſe the Church is a Hierarchie. This grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d <hi>M. Doctour</hi> hath proued in his 9. <hi>Chapter</hi> of his <hi>Hierarchie</hi> where he hath shewed, how Bishops, &amp; inferiour Paſtours are to gouerne the Church, to preach, and adminiſter Sacraments. Secondly in his 12. <hi>Chapter,</hi> where he hath proued that Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops are ſo neceſſarie in the Church, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſubſiſt without them. And thirdlie in his 13. <hi>Chapter,</hi> where he hath could vs how euen in the time of perſecution, though it was the greater for the Bishops preſence, the Church was, and ought to be gouerned by Bishops. Whence it is conſequent, that by the diuine law, the Church muſt be gouerned by Bishops, and that in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall there muſt be particular Bishops in the Church of God: Which <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> alſo grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth with <hi>Suarez n.</hi> 17. And why are Bishops neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, but to gouerne, to preach, and miniſter Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. Out of which aſſured ground, I argue in this manner. There muſt be by the diuine law Bishops in the Church to gouerne it, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentlie as manie as may ſuffice to ſupplie the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:10252:58"/>neceſſities the Church hath of gouernment, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and Sacraments: therefore by the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Inſtitution and precept, there muſt be at leſt a Bishop in euerie notable parte of the Church, ſuch as is France, Spaine, England; for that fewer will not ſuffice; one Bishop being not ſufficient to ſerue all France, England, &amp; Spaine, and in particular to confirme by the Sacrament of Confirmation all French and English.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. I inſtance in <hi>Confirmation,</hi> becauſe other Sacraments may more eaſilie be in ſome ſort ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed without a Bishop, eſpeciallie in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie; for that neither the Engliſh can go all into France, nor all the French into Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to receaue Confirmation; neither can one Bishop go to one Countrie to ſerue it of Confirmation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preiudice to the other countrie; nor can he, being but one, ſuffice for ſo many. Wherefore England muſt haue its owne Bishop, France its owne, Spaine its owne, and ſo of the reſt, if they be notable partes of the Church; all hauing the like neceſſitie; and there being the ſame reaſon of one, which is of another. And ſo <hi>M. Doctour</hi> in his 14. <hi>Chapter n.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 376. argueth well from the like neceſſitie in this manner: <hi>By the diuine law there muſt be particular Bishops in the Church,</hi> to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the neceſſities of particular Churches, <hi>but there is no more reaſon why the particular Church, of France (for he ſpeaketh especiallie of greate particular Churches, which are notable partes of the whole Church) should be gouerned by a Bishop or Bishops,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:10252:58"/>more or fewer, according to the extent of the Countrie, rather then the Church of Spaine; or the Church of England:</hi> Ergo <hi>France, Spaine, and England, and all other ſuch particular Churches of extent, must be gouerned by Bishops;</hi> and euerie one by his owne, all hauing the like neceſſitie.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. <hi>M. Nicholas numer.</hi> 12. wondreth <hi>that a learned man should vſe ſuch a forme of argument,</hi> and therefore to make a shew againſt this argument of <hi>M. Doctour,</hi> be bringeth other arguments verie ridiculous, which though they may ſeeme to the ignorante to be like, yet indeed are not ſo like as chalke and cheiſe. His firſt argument of diuers meates doth argue that hee was hungrie for wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of arguments, elſe he would not haue made vſe of one ſo weake and leane. Thus he argueth: <hi>Some meate is neceſſarie for the maintenance of man, but there is no more reaſon, why egges or fish should be neceſſarie, rather then other particular meates;</hi> Ergo <hi>egges, fish and all meates are neceſſarie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="30">30. But I meruaile that <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> (if he be learned) could not ſee the difference betwixt his owne and <hi>M. Doctours</hi> argument. For that hee ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>argueth from the neceſſitie of ſome indetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate meanes, to the neceſſitie of ſome determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate meanes: <hi>Maiſter Doctour</hi> argueth from like ends to the like neceſſarie meanes. The firſt manner of arguing, which <hi>Maiſter Nicholas</hi> vſeth, is ridiculous. For it followeth not: Meate which is an indeterminate meane, is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie for mans life. <hi>Ergo</hi> this meate; Bishops
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:10252:59"/>are neceſſarie in the Church: <hi>Ergo</hi> this Bishop in particular; Marriage of ſome men is neceſſarie to maintaine lawfullie mankind: <hi>Ergo</hi> this man muſt marrie. <hi>M. Doctours</hi> manner of arguing is good and ſolid; for that it is grounded in paritie and equalitie of reaſon,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>1.</hi> Post or c. <hi>4.</hi> &amp; <hi>5.</hi>
                     </note> or in this principle knowne by the light of reaſon: <hi>Quod conuenit alicui quâtale conuenit omni tali, that which agreeth to a thing, as it is ſuch a thing, agreeth to euerie ſuch thing:</hi> as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, ſayeth Ariſtotele, becauſe it agreeth to a Triangle, as it is a Triangle, to haue three angles equall to two right angles; it agreeth to euerie Triangle to haue three angles equall to two right angles; but becauſe it agreeth not to a triangle, as it is a triangle, to be of braſſe, euerie triangle is not of braſſe. And ſo becauſe it is neceſſarie to a notable parte of the Church, as it is a notable parte, to haue a Bishop, and that alſo by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine law, becauſe one Bishop cannot ſerue ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientlie two notable partes of the Church, euerie notable parte muſt haue its Bishop. And there being the ſame reaſon of England, Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, Spaine, euerie one of theſe countries, being of ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that one Bishop cannot ſerue two of them, euerie one of them muſt haue its Bishop by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of reaſon; and for that it being neceſſarie to a Church to haue a Bishop, becauſe it is a notable parte, euerie ſuch notable part muſt haue a Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop: Becauſe <hi>quod conuenit alicui, quâ tale, conuenit omnitali: that which agreeth to a thing, as it is ſuch a thing, agreeth to euerie ſuch thing.</hi> And if it be
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:10252:59"/>neceſſarie to one, it is neceſſarie to another.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. If <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> his argument had beene thus framed, it had beene good: Meate or food in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall is neceſſarie to ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s life: but there is nomore reaſon of one man then another (for that all mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall men do need meate or food) <hi>Ergo</hi> meate or food is neceſſarie ot euerie ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s life, but this food in particular, as egges or fish is not neceſſarie.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> his ſecond argument is as ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous: for that by it he argueth from an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate meane, to wit, from men whoe are neceſſarie to maintaine by marriage mankinde, to euerie particular man. Which kinde of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not the ſame with that of <hi>M. Doctour;</hi> but as fond as this: A shippe indeterminatelie is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to paſſe from Douer to Calais, <hi>Ergo</hi> euerie particular shippe.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. His thirde argument is of the ſame or of a worſe forme and ſtampe: <hi>Religious inſtitute in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall is of the diuine iuſtitution, and the Supreme Bishop is by his office obliged on his parte to procure that in the Catholike Church ſo ſacred an inſtitute be maintained: but there is no reaſon why it should be be maintained rather in France or Spaine, then in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland:</hi> Ergo <hi>the Pope is obliged to maintaine the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious inſtitute in England.</hi> To his <hi>maior</hi> or firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition I anſwere that religious orders can be no more norſo much neceſſarie in the Church,<note place="margin">I. 2. <hi>q.</hi> 108. <hi>ar.</hi> 4.</note> then the Counſailes, in which, according to <hi>S. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> they are grounded; which counſailes are inſtituted by Chriſte, but as <hi>M. Doctour</hi> ſaieth in his <hi>Hierarthie pag.</hi> 300. they are not commanded
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:10252:60"/>to anie, but counſailed onely. And ſo <hi>M. Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> cannot fynde out a diuine precept to oblige the Pope to admitte any religious order, as he is bound to giue Bishops to the Church: and hence it is that the Pope doth much deliberate before he admitte of any new Religious order; and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he admitteth it, he admitteth it onely as profitable to the Church, not as neceſſarie by any diuine law.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. But ſuppoſe it were of the diuine law, that religious orders indeterminatelie and in generall should be in the Church: yet no Religious order is neceſſarie by the diuine law in euerie notable part of the Church, as Bishops are. And ſo it would not be a good argument: Religious orders muſt by the diuine inſtitution be in the Church, <hi>Ergo</hi> in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, or in this or in that particular Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. But, as I haue proued, it is of the diuine law that in euerie notable parte of the Church there muſt be a Bishop; and ſo there being no more reaſon of one ſuch parte, then another, all ſuch partes muſt haue their Bishops. This, I ſuppoſe, would be <hi>M. Doctours</hi> anſwer to that argument. Now let <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> make what he can of this anſwere. Who, verie politikelie perhappes, as he thought, ſaied. <hi>n.</hi> 13. <hi>pag.</hi> 50. <hi>When M. Doctour shall tell me what he thinketh of this manner of argument, I will then let him know what good vſe I shalbe able to make of his anſwere, whatſoeuer it be.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="35">35. And by this <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> his fourth argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will proue to haue the ſame fault that the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:10252:60"/>others had: <hi>It is not of the diuine law, as</hi> M. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour <hi>confeſſeth, to haue a Bishop in euerie particular Church or Dioceſe; but if we reſpect the diuine law, there is not more reaſon of one, then another,</hi> Ergo <hi>all the Dioceſes of England may be gouerned without a Bishop.</hi> But <hi>M. Doctour</hi> would deny his <hi>maior,</hi> as it is Fathered on him: for he neither affirmeth nor denyeth that euerie Dioceſe muſt haue its Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop: onely he ſayeth <hi>pag.</hi> 375. that it is not ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that by the diuine law, there muſt be a Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop in this or that particular Church, as that in generall there muſt be Bishops in the Church: &amp; <hi>pag.</hi> 376. he ſaieth that it is of the diuine law, that euerie notable parte of the Church should haue its Bishop. It is true <hi>Sotus</hi> ſaieth that it is of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine law that euerie Dioceſe should haue its Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop: but M. <hi>Doctour</hi> neither affirmeth it, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth it. Secondly I anſwere that there is more reaſon and neceſſitie of a Bishop in a whole countrie or Kingdome, which is a notable parte of the Church, then in euerie particular Dioceſe, becauſe one Bishop may in ſome ſort gouerne two Dioceſes, but not all France, Spaine, or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, or any ſuch notable parte, as I haue she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, and one Dioceſe may be aſſiſted by the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop of the next Dioceſe, but not one great Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie by the Bishop of another countrie, as I haue alſo proued.</p>
                  <p n="36">36. By this <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> may gather an anſwere to that his queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <hi>n.</hi> 16. whether that England &amp; Scotland <hi>Iure diuino</hi> muſt alſo haue an <hi>Ordinarie.</hi>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:10252:61"/>For if England &amp; Scotland be both notable par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of the Church, both ought to haue by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine law their proper Bishop: be he <hi>Ordinarie or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legate:</hi> &amp; when men demaund any thing, there is more reaſon to demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that which is ordinarie, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which is extraordinarie. And if the Pope thinke beſt to giue a <hi>Delegate;</hi> as ſo he may ſupplie Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds wantes, ſo that is not the ordinarie courſe obſerued in other Churches. And ſo Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d may demaund an <hi>Ordinarie,</hi> and leaue the reſt to the Chiefe Paſtours diſcretion, who is to Iudge whether he should giue an <hi>Ordinarie,</hi> or <hi>delegate,</hi> &amp; whether the diuine law obligeth to giue vnto a countrie a Bishop in this or that circumſtance.</p>
                  <p n="37">37. Out of all this I gather how vnwilling <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> is to haue a Bishop. I graunt that he ſayeth <hi>pag.</hi> 204. that he <hi>would moſt willinglie ſpend his blood for the purchaſſing of times ſutable with the enjoying of a Catholike Bishop in England.</hi> But what is that time which <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth ſutable for the enioying of a Bishop? Would he haue a time which the ſupreme Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour (whoſe office it is to giue Paſtours to euerie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Church) thinketh in his iudgement ſutable? That tyme is alreadie come. Would he haue a time in which the countrie hath men of its owne, in it to be Bishops? that time is alſo come: for that two moſt worthie Prelates haue beene thought by the ſupreme Paſtour ſit and worthie to be ſent, the one after the other. Would he haue a tyme in which there are not particular lawes
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:10252:61"/>enacted againſt the Bishop? no confiſcation of goods, no loſſe of libertie or life executed on them, that receiue Confirmation of him? That tyme alſo is come. Would he haue England alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether Catholike, and no vſe of any other reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to be permitted in it, but Catholike, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would haue a Bishop come? If that tyme onely be in <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> his opinion ſutable, the primatiue Church liued in no time ſutable for a Bishop; and yet Chriſt conſtituted his Apoſtles Bishops, and they conſtituted others in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt rage and furie of perſecution, as <hi>M. Doctour</hi> hath shewed in his 13. <hi>Chapter n.</hi> 3. And to ſay that a time of perſecution is not ſutable for a Bishop, is to ſay, that when the enemie is in the field, it is not a time ſutable to haue a Generall; when the woulfe is ready to ſet on the flocke, it is not a time ſutable to haue a Paſtour. And ſo the tyme of the primatiue Church, in which the Church was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalted by perſecutours, in all Countries, and on all ſides, was not a time ſutable for enioying a Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop. And yet that is the tyme in which there is moſt need of him, to giue them by <hi>Confirmation</hi> ſpirituall force and ſtrength, to direct them by his counſaile, to encourage them by his preſence, and example. If none of theſe tymes be ſutable for a Bishop in <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> his opinion: The primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Chriſtians should haue beene without a Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop, till the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> appeaſed perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; and Chriſt should not haue ſent his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to gouerne, preach and confirme, till the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:10252:62"/>ſaied tyme of <hi>Conſtantine:</hi> for all the tymes before being times of perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, were not by <hi>M.

If then neither the tyme that Chriſt thought fit to ſend Bishops, nor the tyme that the Apoſtles or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Bishops, nor the time that Chriſt his chiefe Vicaires haue thought ſutable for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying of a Bishop in England, be ſutable in <hi>M.

Where <hi>M.

                  <p n="4">4. And yet that <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> in the beginning of this 4. <hi>question,</hi> chargeth <hi>M.

                  <p n="5">5. But <hi>M. Doctour</hi> ſpeaketh in generall: and if becauſe in particular no man is bound to hazard any notable temporall loſſe for the Bishop, or
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:10252:65"/>Confirmation, he may inferre that the countrie may except againſt the Bishop and that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; by the like reaſon it may be inferred, that becauſe no man is bound to receiue a prieſt ſecular or regular into his houſe, or to receiue any Sacrament of him, or to heare his ſermon with hazard of loſſe of goods, libertie or life, he may except againſt the comming in of Secular and Regular Prieſts. For though there be not the like neceſſitie of a Bishop &amp; Prieſts in all pointes, yet if one argument concludeth, the other muſt conclude: eſpeciallie in <hi>M.

VVho yet, as</hi> M.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, neither is a countrie whence it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> his manner of arguing, that if a priuat perſon be not bound to receiue a Prieſt with that hazard, a countrie is not bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue Prieſts into it with hazard of perſecution. But the generall ſpirituall loſſe is greater the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> anie particular loſſe as <hi>M.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie should want a Bishop or Prieſtes, then that a priuat man should want them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> in the beginning of this queſtion, fearing be like that he might ſeeme no
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:10252:66"/>good Catholike in writing againſt the neceſſitie of the Bishop, and Confirmation; proteſteth <hi>that be reuerenceth Confirmation, and that when Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can conuenientlie be had</hi> (and when is it more neceſſarie then in time of perſecution, againſt which it is inſtituted?

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:10252:66"/>the want of him is ſuch a loſſe, that we should rather hazard perſecution, then to be depriued of a Bishop.

Wherein he playeth foule playe, in taking theſe reaſons a parte; becauſe <hi>virtus vnita eſt fortior ſeipſa diſperſa;</hi> and a child will breake a sheffe of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes one by one, which ioyned in one boundell he cannot; and many vnited can draw a ship, which ſeuered they cannot; and ſo all <hi>M.

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:10252:73"/>the ſeuenfould grace of the spirit, becauſe otherwiſe he cannot be a perfect Chriſtian (where M.

                  </p>
                  <p n="21">21. Yet let vs heare how <hi>M.

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:10252:73"/>thankes be to God, a Bishop willing to giue that Sacrament, and there is no ſpeciall law againſt him, and neuer any as yet hath bene perſecuted for hauing taken it, <hi>Confirmation,</hi> at leaſt the perſecution is not ſo great, but that thouſandes haue taken it. And theſe words which <hi>M Doctour</hi> left out, as they are ſome what obſcure, ſo they are as much againſt <hi>M. Nicholas,</hi> as <hi>M. Doctour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="22">22. For firſt he ſayeth out of <hi>Eſtius,</hi> that when <hi>S.

And then will I adde theſe words in which <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> ſayeth the point of the controuerſie conſiſteth, <hi>if not by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, but by careleſſeneſſe, or voluntarilie, he shall remaine ſo: ergo</hi> if not by careleſſeſſe, but out of neceſſitie he want <hi>Confirmation,</hi> he may he a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Chriſtian, that is, perfectlie anointed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; which were to ſay, he may be perfectlie anointed without perfect vnction, and ſo haue it without hauing it.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. Secondlie his third anſwere to <hi>S. Clements</hi> words <hi>pag.</hi> 81. (as aboue we haue ſeene) was, that the ancient practiſe was to giue <hi>baptiſme</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation</hi> together: and that therefore when <hi>S.

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:10252:74"/>
                     <hi>M.

Wherefore vnleſſe we will make <hi>S.

Nicholas</hi> inferreth, that if of neceſſitie one want <hi>Confirmation,</hi> he may be a perfect Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian without it: for that were to contradict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, he hauing ſayed before, that vnleſſe one be conſigned, he cannot be a perfect Chriſtian. And ſo whether he want <hi>Confirmation</hi> voluntarilie or of neceſſitie, he cannot be a perfect Chriſtian Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentallie as aboue is ſayed; as whether vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarilie or by neceſſitie he want Baptiſme, he is no Chriſtian. Wherefore the ſenſe of theſe words muſt not be, that which <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> gathereth, but ſome other, and as it is verie probable, it is this ſenſe following, which is gathered out of the words which <hi>M Nicholas</hi> left out, which are thoſe, <hi>nor haue place amongst the perfect, if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ſo, not by neceſſitie</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. This then is the ſenſe of S <hi>Clements</hi> words. <hi>All therefore muſt make haſte without delay to be rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated to God, and then to be conſigned by the Bishop,

                  <p>M. Nicholas maketh M. Doctour <hi>ſay more then he doth, to wit that euery one in particular is bound to take</hi> Confirmation <hi>with hazard of perſecution, whereas</hi> M.

                  <p n="29">29.

But howſoeuer, although euerie man in particular ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be condemned of ſinne for omitting Confirmation, for feare of looſing his life, lands, or libertie, Yet I thinke that neither any countrie or any one of the countrie, for feare of perſecution, can oppoſe againſt the coming in of a Bishop, though thereby, onely the Sacrament of Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation hould be wanting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="30">30. So that <hi>M Nicholas</hi> playeth not faire playe with <hi>M. Doctour</hi> in making him ſay that Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes in particular are bound to receiue Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation with loſſe of life, libertie or goods, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:10252:78"/>as <hi>M. Doctour</hi> confeſſeth in the a foreſayed place, and before it alſo <hi>num.</hi> 3. &amp; 4. graunteth, that none in particular are bound with ſuch danger; and onelie ſayeth, that neither a countrie nor any one of the countrie (which yet he humblie ſubmitteth to authoritie) can except againſt a Bishop, or Confirmation for feare of perſecution in generall; notwithſtanding which generall perſecution, many commodiouſlie and without danger may receiue Confirmation. And this <hi>Eſtius,</hi> when he ſayeth, that if Confirmation can commodiouſlie be had in time of perſecution, it cannot be refuſed by particular perſons vnder mortuall ſinne, ſuppoſeth.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. The reaſon of this is, becauſe there may be a generall perſecution, and yet many in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, may commodiouſlie haue Confirmation. for as notwithſtanding perſecution, and the generall lawes of England enacted againſt receiuing a Prieſt, hearing Maſſe or going to Confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, many Catholikes in particular without morall danger may many tymes receiue a Prieſt, heare Maſſe, and goe to Confeſſion, as thouſands haue done: ſo many Catholikes may receiue the Bishop, and Confirmation of him without any imminent or morall danger; and therefore hetherto not any haue ſuffered loſſe in life, libertie or goods for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmation though thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued it. And as, although perſecution in England is the greater for Prieſts, Ieſuites, and other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars, yet many can, and do without morall
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:10252:79"/>danger heare Maſſe (as they are bound on holy dayes, when they can commodiouſlie) can goe to Confeſſion and the like: ſo although the perſecution in England were greater for the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop (as it is not, there being no ſpeciall lawes in force againſt him) yet many might receiue him, and Confirmation of him, without any immine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t danger: and conſequentlie according to <hi>Eſtius</hi> his opinion, are bound vnder mortall ſinne to receiue Confirmation, when there is danger, by reaſon of infirmitie, of denying their faith, or of fearing to profeſſe it when they should. And ſo I meruaile that <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> could not ſee the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, betwixt perſecution in generall, and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, for that perſecution in generall doth not excuſe particular men from receiuing Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they, notwithſtanding a generall perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hauing commoditie to receiue it without danger: but when the perſecution is particular to men in particular, then they cannot without danger, and ſo are excuſed. yet nether a countrie nor any of the countrie can except againſt Prieſts coming into the countrie by reaſon of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall perſecution, becauſe notwithſtanding ſuch a perſecution, many in particular may heare Maſſe, receiue the B. Sacrament, goe to confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, heare a ſermon now and then, without imminent danger; and ſo for reſpect and regard of theſe (who haue right to the Sacrament) none can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept againſt the coming in of Prieſts: into a countrie ſeing that if the countrie were depriued
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:10252:79"/>of Prieſts, none could heare Maſſe, goe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, receiue the Sacraments, or heare exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and ſo at this day, if Prieſts had not bene ſent into England maugre perſecution, there had now ſcarce any Catholike or Catholike Religion bene left in England: <hi>&amp; niſi Dominus exercituum reliquiſſet nobis ſemen, quaſi Sodoma ſuiſſemus, &amp; quaſi Gomorrha ſimiles eſſemus: Vnleſſe the Lord of Hoſtes had left vs</hi> (this) <hi>ſeed we had bene as Sodome, and we should be like to Gomorrha.</hi>

So although no man in particular be bound to receiue the Bishop into his houſe, or Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of him with imminent danger of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſayed temporall loſſes: Yet a countrie could not except againſt a Bishop or Confirmation, for feare of perſecution in generall: for that, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſuch a generall perſecution, many might without the aforeſayed danger receiue a Bishop and Confirmation at his hands, as wee ſee they haue done in England.

                  <p n="41">41. Thirdelie in tyme of perſecution when one is apprehended and brought before the perſecutour, he vſeth to threaten loſſe of Landes and goods, libertie and life it ſelfe: hee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore who in tyme of perſecution ſeeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe expoſed to all theſe difficulties, had neede to arme himſelfe by all the meanes he can: and (whatſoeuer <hi>Maiſter Nicholas</hi> ſayeth) he may feare his owne infirmitie, for that it is not an eaſie thing, euen with ordinarie grace, to forſake Landes, goods, libertie, life, Father, mother, wife, and children, rather then to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or not to profeſſe his faith; and it is aboue the force of flesh and blood: and although he may haue grace ſufficient (as manie in our Countrie without Confirmation haue had) yet this grace which giueth force to profeſſe our faith before the Tyrant, is not due to anie but theſe who are confirmed, to whom it is due by the Sacrament and character which

                     <hi>Whether A vow not to be religious be wicked; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one may vow not to accept a Bishopricke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="23">23. All that <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> here alleadgeth is litle to the purpoſe; for although there may be ſome commodities in a religious life, as leſſe da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger more ſecuritie, more meanes to mortifie ſenſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and that therefore one may rather vow to be religious then to be a Bishop, or to accept of that office and dignitie, yet all would not proue that the ſtate of a religious man is an higher ſtate or as high, which yet is the thing we diſpute of; for as the litle shrubbe is leſſe shaken with the winds then the Cedar, yet is not taller then it: and as the low cottage is leſſe beaten by tempeſts then the princelie pallace, yet is not higher, ſo the religious life may be a more ſecure, yet not a more perfect ſtate.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. But ſayeth <hi>M. Nicholas n.</hi> 5. the more volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie the election of a Religious life is, the more commendable it is, and the ſtate of a Bishop is hen moſt ſecurelie accepted of, when it is leſſe
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:10252:95"/>willinglie accepted. I graunte this. But why? not becauſe a Religious life is a perfecter ſtate, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it being a lower ſtate is leſſe ſubiect to dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, &amp; ſo may more willinglie be deſired &amp; vowed. He proceedeth <hi>n.</hi> 6. <hi>a vow made of not accepting a Bishopricke is valid and holy. A vow not to become re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious is wicked, and of no force:</hi> ergo ſayeth he, <hi>there muſt be ſomething wherein a religious ſtate ſurpaſſeth that of a Bishop.</hi> By the ſame argument <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> might preferre a religious ſtate before the ſate of the Pope, becauſe a man may vowe to be reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious yet he may not vow to be Pope; or if he may vow not to accept a Bishoprike, much more may he vow not to accept the Popedome.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. Wherefore I demaund of <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> when he ſaieth that for this cauſe, <hi>there muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wherein a religious life ſurpaſſeth that of a Bishop,</hi> What he meaneth by his <hi>ſomething?</hi> if he meane ſome degree of ſtate or perfectim, wherein the religious life ſurpaſſeth that of the Bishop, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicteth <hi>S. Thomas</hi> and <hi>Suarez</hi> &amp; all that aboue is alleadged to proue the ſtate of a Bishop to be the higheſt ſtate of perfection. If he meane by that <hi>ſomething</hi> more ſecuritie, leſſe danger, and perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture ſome better meanes to tame our flesh, to bridle our concupiſcence, to remoue the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments of the loue of God, in which conſiſteth perfection: it is not to the purpoſe. For ſo there is ſomething in a flye which is not in an Eagle, ſomething in a mouſe which is not in a Lio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſome thing in a litle shrubbe, which is not in a Cedar
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:10252:95"/>ſomething in a flint which is not in a Saphire, and yet abſolutelie the Eagle ſurpaſſeth the flie, the Lion the mouſe, the Cedar the shrubbe; the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>it, and ſo there may be ſomething in a religious ſtate which is not in the ſtate of a Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop, though this ſtate abſolutelie ſurpaſſe that.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. But <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> obiecteth that to vow not to be religious, is wicked and inualid, to vow not to accept a Bishoprick is laudable and valid: <hi>ergo</hi> a religious ſtate hath ſome good which a Bishops ſtate hath not; elſe this might be vowed as well as that. I anſwere, firſt that to ſweare at leaſt in ſome caſe not to be religious is not wicked &amp; yet an oath hath a greate affinitie with a vowe. For <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> knoweth that the Sea Apoſtolike hath commanded all theſe who will enioy the benefit of the Popes Seminaries, to ſweare that they wilbe Prieſts, and will not enter into any religious order or congregation without licence of the Pope, vnleſſe they firſt labour in the miſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſpace of three yeares.

                     </note> that for one to ſweare that he will not enter into religion, or receiue holy orders is but a veniall ſinne, <hi>ergo</hi> it is not to be called wicked: for ſaith he if to ſweare to commit a veniall ſinne be but a veniall ſinne, to ſweare not to be religious to which, vnder noe ſinne he is bound, can be but a veniall ſinne.</p>
                  <p n="27">27.<note place="margin">Nau. c. <hi>12.</hi> n.</note> Secondlie I anſwere with the ſame Nauarre more directlie, that to vow not to be religious byndeth not, and therefore, notwithſtanding that
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:10252:96"/>vow, one may be religious; yet ſuch a vow is but a veniall ſinne, and ſo cannot be called <hi>wicked</hi> as <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> calls it, becauſe in our English ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, <hi>wicked</hi> ſoundeth as doth <hi>impium</hi> in the Latin tongue, and is taken for a grieuous or mortall ſinne. And therefore <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> could not call him that committeth onelie a veniall ſinne, a wicked or impious man.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. Thirdely I anſwere that although to vow not to procure to be a Bishop may be holy and valid, yet to vow not to accept a Bishopricke when it is impoſed on a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the Pope and in neceſſitie of the Church, is not holie and valid, but it is rather wicked and inualid. For that to vow not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a Bishopricke in that caſe, is to vow a great diſobedience againſt authoritie, and which alſo in that caſe, is againſt the Charitie we vow to God his Church, and ſo the vow is wicked being a vow of a mortall ſinne, and it is inualid becauſe it is not <hi>de meliori bono,</hi> not of an act which is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter done then vndone, for that in that caſe it is not better not to accept a Bishopricke impoſed by Authoritie, then to accept it.<note place="margin">2. 2.<hi>q.</hi> 185. <hi>ar.</hi> 2.</note> Wherefore <hi>S.

                  <p n="29">29.

And <hi>M. Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi> cannot deny, but that the ſtate &amp; dignitie of the perſon addeth merit to his actions. For as the regulars actions by reaſon of his ſtate and vow, are more meritorious then are the ſame actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s done by other Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s not regulars: ſo not onely the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops actions proper to his ſtate, are of greater per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and merit then the proper actions of regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars: but alſo the ſame actions done by a regular &amp; a Bishop, are more meritoriousin a Bishop the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in a regular. For as <hi>M.

                  <p n="45">45. And now one would thinke that <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> had made an end of his (I feare) too odious compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons of the ſtate of a regular with the ſtate of a Bishop: but it ſeemeth he hath reſerued the moſt

                  <p n="57">57. This man was Abbot of a Monaſterie called <hi>Bona Spes; Good Hope</hi> and he wrote aboue fowre hundred and fiftie yeares agoe. His workes were printed in Doway in the yeare M. D C. X X. and approued by Doctour Colvenerius Chauncelour of the Vniuerſitie, and Cenſor of Bookes in that Vniuerſitie. He in his worke <hi>De Dignitate, Scientia, Iuſtieia, &amp; Continentia Clericorum,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth highlie Regulars (amongſt whom he was verie eminent,) yet in euery chapter almoſt, he preferreth the Clergie, I will (for breuities ſake) cite only a fewe paſſages. In his 17. Chapter he ſayth, as <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> will not ſaye; <hi>Noſtrum eſt nouiſsimum locum eligere, nec ad altiora volatu praeſumptuoſo nos ipſos erigere: It is our parte</hi> (that is the part of Religious) <hi>to cbooſe the laſt place and not by a preſumptuous flight to eleuate our ſelues to higher thing.</hi> In his 17.

In his 84. chapter he ſayth, that the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>S.

                  <p n="57">57. Out of this which I haue ſayd of the ſtate and dignitie of Bishops and Inferiour Paſtours (which I hope will not offend, it being all or the moſt parte taken out of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Authours) may be gathered in how high and perfect a ſtate or calling, not of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to be acquired, but to be exerciſed and communicated to others, the Prieſts of our Seminaries, and Religious houſes are, who are ſent in an Apoſtolicall miſsion into England, to conuert Heretikes, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime Schiſmatiques, to gouerne and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort Catholiques, to illuminate, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and purge the people by preaching, catechiſing, adminiſtring the Sacraments, and by offering the dreadfull ſacrifice of the maſſe: who are to shewe the people the wayes to good life, vertue, and perfection, not only by wholſome connſailes and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, but alſo by good examples; who are to labour day and night, on horſe backe, on foote, and to expoſe their libertie, yea liues, for the gaining gouerning, and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ſoules.</p>
                  <p n="58">58. This office, and calling is the greateſt, as being the calling of the Apoſtles, who were ſent by their maſter Chriſte to trauerſe the world for the gaining of ſoules: this was the calling and office of our Lord and maſter Chriſte Ieſus, who was incarnate and became
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:10252:120"/>man, liued and conuerſed with vs, preached, wrought miracles, gaue examples of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and perfection, and at laſt ſuffered a cruel death on the infamous Croſſe for the redeeming and gaining of ſoules. This is the greateſt calling a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d office in this life. For there is no greater calling, after that of Chriſte, then an Apoſtolicall calling, ſnch as this is: And the reaſon is, becauſe there is no greater per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection then charitie,<note place="margin">Ioa. <hi>15.</hi>
                     </note> and there is no greater charitie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to expoſe once life for the ſauing of ſoules.</p>
                  <p n="59">59. And let not any meruell that I call this an Apoſtolicall calling, becauſe in this, all Paſtours, and eſpecially they who are ſent in miſsion to conuert ſoules, doe ſucceed and imitate the Apoſtles: and as the miſſion of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preachers to other countries, as firſt of <hi>Fugatius</hi> and <hi>Damianus,</hi> then of <hi>S Auſtme</hi> and his companions to our countrie, and of <hi>S. Denys</hi> to France, <hi>S. Palladias</hi> to Scotland, <hi>S. Roniſace</hi> to Germanie, is worthily called A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall, they all being ſent by the Se 2 Apoſtolique of Rome, which euer ſent prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers to forraine Countries: ſo they who now are ſent in miſsion to England with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention only to gaine ſoules, are ſent by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall miſsion, becauſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſame ſea and authoritie. And in this, as our Seminarie Prieſts doe excelle all other Prieſts; ſoe our Religious doe excelle all other Religious
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:10252:121"/>what ſoeuer, who are not ſent in ſuch an Apoſtolicall miſsion, but liue quietlie in their Celles, endeuour their owne ſaluation and perfection, but are, not ſent in miſsion as our English Regulars are to conuerte, and to ſaue the ſoules of others.</p>
                  <p n="60">60. The queſtion may bee whether as theſe haue the higheſt calling in the Church of God, ſoe they haue alſo a ſtate, And this is not ſoe certaine as that To aſtate of perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as we haue ſeene) twothings are required. The firſt that it be ordained to acts of perfection: The ſecond that it be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueable by vowe, oathe, promſſe, pacte, or conuenant. The ſtate of Seminarie Prieſts wanteth not the firſt, as euen now I shewed: only there may ſeeme to be wanting in them an immobilitie which is required to a ſtate as <hi>S. Thomas</hi> hath deliuered,<note place="margin">2.2.9. 134. <hi>a.</hi> 4.</note> but if that were wanting it would not derogate to the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Seminarie Prieſts office a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d calling, becauſe ſtill it should be ordained to the moſt perfect actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d this is the principall in aſtate of perfection, and by this, oneſtate is iudged to be more perfect or eminent then another.</p>
                  <p n="61">61.

                  <p n="69">69. But (ſaith <hi>M. Nicolas</hi>) <hi>M.

It is true <hi>M. Doctour</hi> ſayd ſo in his Hierarchie, and why
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:10252:127"/>should you now ſeeke to draw him into an odious ſenſe, as though he meant now to deny it, and would leaue to Regulars only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall leauing of things without the loue of God. Religious may and doe no doubt often tymes leaue all actuallie for the loue of god: and the Bishop, as <hi>S. Thomas</hi> ſayth, and all good Chriſtians out of God his loue are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared only to leaue all: and ſo the difference betwixt Religious and other Chriſtians is, that the Religious leaue all actuallie, other Chriſtians not actuallie, but in preparation of mynd. And the actuall leauing of all is no perfection, but a meanes to get perfection, vnleſſe it be ioyned with the loue of God. And therfore <hi>M.

                     </note> 
                     <hi>that the former</hi> that is the actuall, leauing of all <hi>Is noe perfection but an inſtrument of perfection vnleſſe it be ioyned with the loue of God in which conſiſteth perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>

                  <p n="70">70. So that <hi>M. Doctour</hi> granteth more perfection to the Religious then he doth to other Chriſtians. For he confeſſeth that they ſo loue God that they not only are willing for the loue of God, to obſerue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements as other Chriſtians ought to bee, but alſo the Counſels; and they are not only willing for his loue to leaue all in prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of mynd as good Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are, but alſo (which is more) for his loue doe actuallie
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:10252:127"/>leaue all. Only this is the difference, that actuall leauing of all may be without the loue of God (for although many noe doubt leaue all for God his loue yet ſome doe not) but the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of mynd to leaue all rather then offend God mortallie, is ſoe neerly linked to the loue of God that as <hi>Caietan</hi> aboue ſayth,<note place="margin">Caiet. <hi>22.</hi> q. <hi>184.</hi> art. <hi>7.</hi>
                     </note> it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable companion or neceſſarie effect of Charitie. And therfore both <hi>S.

And in this ſame ſenſe, Bishops, Arch-Bishops, and Primates elected onlie but not in any order, are not of the Hierarchie; and ſo if they be not conſecrated Bishops, they are not of the order of Bishops, if they be not conſecrated Prieſts, they are not of the order of Prieſts. <hi>But if vvee ſpeake</hi> (ſayth M.

                  <p>To his other demaund n. 4. he is alſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in the Hierarchie chap. 5. n. 18. and 21. for if the fowre leſſer orders be of the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutition of the Church, as ſome Authours ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>M. Doctour</hi> affirme, then they who are vnder Subdeacons, are of the Hierarchie in regard of order, by the Churches lawe and inſtitution, and not by the diuine lawe and inſtitution: but if they be of the diuine inſtitution, then theſe Miniſters who are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Subdeacons, are of the Hierarchie in regard of order by the diuine inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And ſeing that Regulars who are neither Bishops, Prieſts, Deacons, Subdeacons, nor Accoly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, &amp;c. haue neither order nor iuriſdiction
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:10252:147"/>ouer the Church, as other Miniſters of the Hierarchie haue, they cannot as Regulars, be of the Hierarchie. And therfore if an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot had only <hi>primam Tonſuram, the first Tonſure,</hi> which is no order although he haue iuriſdiction ouer his Monkes; Yet he should not be of the Hierarchie of the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath neither order, nor Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call iuriſdiction but only Regular. And ſo an Abbot as Abbot though he haue ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie power in his Religious order is not ſo much of the Hierarchie as a Bishop delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: becauſe an Abbot not Bishop, Prieſt, &amp;c. is not of the Hierarchie at all, but the delegated Bishop hath both order and iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and ſo by both wayes is of the Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchie. And therfore S. Denys as we haue ſeene, excludeth all Regulars from the Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchie, and yet ſome of them had iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ouer other Monkes. VVherefore Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars muſt not take this in euill parte, for I giue them as much as S.

And I alſo honour them not only for their Religious ſtate, but alſo for their dignitie in Religion: But if S.

                  <p n="33">33. Secondlie I anſwere that Mauclerus intended not in that place exactlie to decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re who are properlie of the Hierarchie of the Church, but only to shew how ſome in the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:10252:150"/>Church militant reſemble one order of the Hierarchie, ſome another, though they be not properlie of the Hierarchie,<note place="margin">Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cl. <hi>1.</hi> p. l. <hi>5.</hi> c. <hi>5.</hi> de Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch.</note> as S.

And if for this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance which they haue with Seraphins, they are of the Hierarchie of the Church mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant, they should be in the higheſt ranke of the Eccleſiaſticall Hierarchie, becauſe they reſemble the higheſt order of the Angelicall Hierarchie; and ſo should haue an higher ranke then Bishops; and yet S.

                  <p n="34">34. Heere <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> vrgeth vs with the definition of a Hierarchie, and argueth, as he thinketh, <hi>à definitione ad definitum,</hi> which is one of the beſt manners of arguing. For if from the definition of a Hierarchie Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:10252:151"/>are not excluded, they can not be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the thing defined, that is from the Hierarchie.

Denys should define a Hierarchie in the se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe in which <hi>M.

And therfore <hi>Dionyſius Carthuſianus</hi> in his <hi>Elucidation</hi> of the 6. chapter of the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall Hierarchie, as aboue wee haue ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, ſayth, that S.

And againe (ſayth <hi>Dion. Carthuſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>) the higher order of theſe which yet are perfected (as S.

                     </note> it is true in S.

Yet all the loweſt orders (as S. Denys teacheth lib. Eccl. Hier. c. 5.) may reſpectiuelie be called orders initiated and perfected in reſpect of the higher Angels.

Nicholas</hi> may ſee, that there is a difference betwixt the Hierarchie of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and of men; for that in S. Thomas his opinion all the Angels as they are euerie one of diſtinct natures, doe exerciſe Hierarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call actions ouer inferiour Angels, and only the laſt Angell is not of the purging, illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating and perfecting Hierarchie, in reſpect of Angels, becauſe he is purged, illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and perfected, of the ſuperior Angell, but purgeth, illuminateth, and perfecteth no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, he being the laſt. And ſo according to this opinion, all the Angels are of the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting Hierarchie ſauing only the loweſt. But the Hierarchie of the Church milita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t though it conſiſt of diuers dignities, orders and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as vnder the Pope, Cardinalles, Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Archbishops, Bishops, Prieſts, Deaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp;c. yet there are many of the ſame order and iuriſdiction, as many Bishops are of the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:10252:157"/>ſame order of Bishops, many Prieſts are of the ſame order of Prieshood. But Regulars as Regulars hauing no Hierarchicall action though they haue other Regular actions, are not of the ruling and perfecting Hierarchie.</p>
                  <p n="40">40. Now as concerning <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> his other example of a Citie, in which are diuers orders, according to diuers actions, as the order of iudges, the order of ſoliders, the order of husbandmen and tillers of the ground: I anſwer that S. Thomas bringeth this example, to shew that there are diuers orders amongeſt the Angels, as there is in a well ordered Citie: but his intention was not to shewe that all the diuers orders in a Citie that haue diuers actions, are of that part of the Citie that ruleth, and directeth, as the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour Angelles illuminate and perfect the inferiour. For in the Citie ſome rule and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne as the Maior and Alderme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and iudges, but the orders of Taylors and show makers, and other artificers, though they haue diuers actions and functions, yet they are not of that part of the Citie which ruleth but which is ruled. And ſo although Regulars haue diuers actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s according to their diuers orders, yet theſe actions being not Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicall, they are not ſufficient to make them of the ruling, purging illuminating, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting Hierarchie; but only they are of the Hierarchie, as the common people that bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:10252:157"/>no rule in the common wealth, is of the Kingdome, amongeſt which people not with ſtanding, there are may artes trades, and actions, which yet doe not make them rulers in the Kingdome.</p>
                  <p n="41">41. And by this <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> is anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to all that he bringeth in the 8. number; for that all he there alleageth in commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Religious orders, proueth only, that Regulars are worthie and eminent members of the Church for their ſanctitie and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of life, but not that they are of the Hierarchie in that ſenſe as S. Denys taketh the Hierarchie, becauſe as Regulars they are not to gouerne the Church, nor to preache and miniſter Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, but only as Bishops or Prieſts, if they be ſo. And <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> should know that oue may be a Saynt, yea and a deſigned and reſolued martyr, and yet not be of the Hierarchie in this ſenſe, as if he be a lay man, or a lay brother. And ſo it is not grace, nor merit, nor mortification, nor perfection which maketh a man of the Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchie, but order, and office, by which he exerciſeth Hierarchicall actions.</p>

<pb n="271" facs="tcp:10252:158"/>is ſo poore an one that I mernell <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> a diuine, should propoſe it. For that deuines know, that by grace men cannot merite to be indeed Angels or Archa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gels, or Cherubins, or Seraphins, but only can merit as greate glorie as they haue: and becauſe ſome ſaintes haue merited as great glorie as Angels, others as Archangels, others as Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubins or Seraphins haue, therfore they are ſayd to be aſſumed to the order of Angels, Archangels or other orders. And becauſe it is not grace but the order, ſtate and office of purging, illuminating, and perfecting, which maketh one of the Hierarchie: a Chriſtian in this life may merite as great glorie, and attaine at length vnto as greate glorie as Cherubins and Seraphins haue, though he was not of any order of the Eccleſiaſticall Hierarchie. And ſo it doth not follow, as <hi>M.

And a laye brother or ſiſter, yea a poore shepheard who was in noe order of the Eccleſiaſticall Hierarchie, but only was of the Hierarchie as the common people is

Now whether this their dignitie of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall be of the diuine lawe, as <hi>Turrecremata</hi> thinketh, or of the Eccleſiaſticall law, I will not diſpute, but referre the reader to <hi>M.

And if by this cuſtome or priuiledge graunted by the Church, Generalles of Religious orders, and Abbots be of the Hierarchie, I will not giane ſaye it: onlie I ſay with <hi>M.

                  <p n="44">44. And therfore wheras <hi>M. Nicholas</hi> n. 10. ſayth that he hath laboured rather for Cardinalles then Regulars in labouring to proue Regulars to be of the Hierarchie: he
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:10252:161"/>hath laboured in vayne, not hauing been able te proue Regulars as Regulars to be of the Hierarchie; and he doth wrong to thoſe moſt eminent Prelates and Pillars of Gods Church, as though they could not be of the Hierarchie vnles Regulars alſo were: wheras Cardinalles by their dignitie and by the care which they haue in gouerning vnder the Pope the vniuerſall Church, are aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Hierarchie as it conſiſteth of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers degrees in power, of iuriſdiction and dignitie, as <hi>M.
